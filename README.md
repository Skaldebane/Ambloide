# Ambloide

> **Development of this project has just began, so it might take some time for the app to have basic functionality. Be patient.**

Ambloide is an IDE that uses Scratch blocks technology to help users without programming experience to create their own apps easily, using their Android device.

This app's concept is taken from the existing (dead, closed source) blocks IDE **Sketchware**.
